Profilerrific - A simple Git-based profiling framework

Usage: profilerrific -s <script>* [-r <revision>*]

Profilerrific runs the scipts listed after `-s` for each revision of the
repository listed after `-r`.

If `-r` revisions are omited, the scripts are run against the working copy.

Recommended workflow:

  * Create a profiling branch
  * Create and commit profiling scripts
  * Make a set of changes that you would like to compare, commit the changes.
    - Repeat for each case you wish to compare.
  * Run: profilerrific -s <scripts> -r <revisions>
    - This will generate data in an untracked folder for analysis
  * Merge the better revision back to master
